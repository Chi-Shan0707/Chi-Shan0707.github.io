> 2026 Winter Vacation

- Mathematical Analysis:  Preview concepts and techs and explore calculus evolutionary history through reading.
- Advanced Algebra: Read LADR (QAQ).
- Algorithms: Delve into Randomized Algorithms before the Spring Festival.

Maybe I had better try extensively in this vacation(instead of trying to wrestle with the theories?), so the following plans are unsure:

- Reinforcement Learning: Try to read books on its mathematical theorem and follow code practice online.
- Diffusion Model: Learn basic comcepts and theories
- LLM: Follow the hands-on-LLM tutorial by SJTU.
